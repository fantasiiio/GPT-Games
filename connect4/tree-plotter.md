# Pygame Tree Visualizer

## Description
This project is a Python application that visualizes tree structures using Pygame. It allows you to interact with the tree by clicking on nodes to select them, using mouse scroll to zoom, and panning the view. The project is useful for understanding hierarchical data structures and for educational purposes.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python and Pygame installed. If you don't have them, you can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Then clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/pygame-tree-visualizer.git
```

## Usage
Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the Pygame window with the tree visualization.

## Features
- **Node Selection**: Click on a node to select it.
- **Zooming**: Use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in and out.
- **Panning**: Hold the middle mouse button and drag to pan across the tree.
- **Node Expansion**: Double-click on a node to expand or collapse it.
