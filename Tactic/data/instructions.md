## Overview

Welcome to this turn-based military strategy game featuring tanks, boats, helicopters, and soldiers. Your objective is to eliminate all the enemy units. The game has 5 phases:

-   Unit Placement
    
-   Random Event
    
-   Planning
    
-   Execution
    
-   Outcome
    

## Pre-Game: Team Building

Before you start, you'll encounter a team-building screen. Here you have a budget to purchase your units. Note that every vehicle requires a driver and a gunner. If a vehicle has only one unit in it, it can only move and not attack.

### Unit Placement

At the beginning of the game, players place their units on the map grid. Once you're satisfied with the placement, click the "End Turn" button to proceed.

### Random Event

At the start of each turn (except for the first turn), a random event will occur. These events can either be good or bad. For example:

-   Team Skill Mastery: All units gain double damage or defense for the next turn.
    
-   Team Sabotage: All units are disabled for one turn.
    

### Planning

After the random event, each player allocates their action points to plan their moves. In multiplayer mode, both players plan their actions simultaneously, hidden from each other's view.

### Execution

Once planning is complete, all actions are executed concurrently. Important points to note:

-   If you target an enemy unit and it moves, the unit still takes damage. However, the unit can dodge the attack by moving to an adjacent tile.
    
-   In case both player 1 and player 2 attack each other, and player 1's attack is fatal, player 2's action will still be executed. Therefore, both players might lose a unit.
    

### Outcome

This phase is where the results of the actions taken during the Execution phase are evaluated. You'll see updates on unit statuses, points scored, and other game metrics. Based on the Outcome, you can strategize for the next turn.

That covers the basics! Now, you're ready to enter the battlefield. Good luck, Commander!
